# Login-System
This is the source code for my login system project.

What I have implemented already:

- Program checks if user is in the database.
- User can create an account through the program.
- User can navigate through GUI pages in the program.
- Seperate account dashboard for each user.
- 2FA.
- A well designed, visually appealing GUI.
- Data Validation
- Password Hashing + Salting

What features I would like to implement:

- Some cryptography elements.
- Eliminate possible vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, etc.
- Add the ability to show the qr code in the app and store it in the database securely.
